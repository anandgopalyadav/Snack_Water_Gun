Summary : 

The 'Snack_Water_Gun' game is a Python program that simulates a playful and interactive game reminiscent of the classic 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game. 
In this game, players choose between three options: 'Snack', 'Water' or 'Gun'.
Each option has its own set of rules dictating the outcome of the game: 'Snack' defeats 'Water' by 'eating' it, 'Water' defeats 'Gun' by 'rusting' it, and 'Gun' defeats 'Snack' by 'shooting' it. 
The program prompts players to input their choice and then randomly selects the computer's choice. 
After both choices are made, the program determines the winner based on the predefined rules and announces the result. 
The game continues until the player decides to quit. 
It's a fun and engaging Python program suitable for players of all ages, offering a modern twist on a timeless game concept.
